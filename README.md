# Flask Boost Extension Documentation
I, as the creator of this extension, I want to mention clearly that this extension is at a development process and is not completely safe. Especially the overboost() method might cause a crash to your server running environment. Since I stated so, I kindly tell you that I am not responsible for any of your disadvantage happened to your codespace, caused by this extension.
